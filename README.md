# _zm_blockers-with-bank-doors
 Fork of Treyarch's T7 (COD: Black Ops III) blockers (buyable doors and debris) which adds co-op bank doors, that any player can contribute to. If on solo, doors will behave as normal.

 This first update contains the stock Treyarch script, the next commit will contain the virtual fork with bank doors.
