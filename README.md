# *_zm_blockers-with-bank-doors*

 Fork of Treyarch's T7 (COD: Black Ops III) blockers (buyable doors and debris) which adds co-op bank blockers, that any player can contribute to. If on solo, blockers will behave as normal.

 The previous update contained the stock Treyarch script, this commit contains the virtual fork with bank doors.

 ## Instructions
 Setup doors and debris as usual. Bank blockers should have `script_noteworthy: bank`

 ## In Game
 Solo: door price is reduced by 250 points
 
 Coop: each time a player presses activate on a door, they add 250 points to the shared pool
